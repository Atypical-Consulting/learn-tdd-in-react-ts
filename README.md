# Learn TDD in React with Typescript

The code contained in this repository is an adaptation of the tutorial presented on
[https://learntdd.in/react/](https://learntdd.in/react/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Changes from the original

- use **TypeScript** in the application and the tests.
- use **@testing-library/user-event** instead of **fireevent** function to makes testing user interaction closer to how an actual user would interact with the app.
- use **Prettier** to formats the code.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn test:coverage`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode with code coverage.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
